## Security Policy

If you think you have identified a security issue with an Encode project, do not open a public issue.

To responsibly report a security issue, please navigate to the Security tab for the repo and click "Report a vulnerability."

Be sure to include as much detail as necessary in your report. As with reporting normal issues, a minimal reproducible example will help the maintainers address the issue faster.

Thank you.
